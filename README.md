I do not take any responsibility, liability or whateverity over any code faults, inconsistency or anything else.

### Notes:
The file layout is due to me using a gitignore directly on my IDE file structure to create this repo (lazyness, I know), but it should be fine.

The generateTPProject bash script is a script I use to generate my projects, see [this repo for more info.](https://github.com/Meiogordo/CUTE-CLion-AEDATPTemplate) (It is for a previous course unit but will work in this one as well, because we are using the same software for unit testing.)

I will also gladly accept any suggestions made in terms of improving the solutions presented here, as they are simply the solutions I come up with during/after the classes. I suggest that those suggestions (heh) be done through pull requests. Given enough justification I will happily accept them :)
